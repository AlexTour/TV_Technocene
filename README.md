# MIXED SIGNALS
## Project Description
Mixed signals

In a world where technology and communication are intertwined, we often find ourselves deciphering mixed signals in communication. Subtle hints, ambiguous messages and ever-changing dynamics can leave us questioning the intentions of others and deciphering unspoken meanings in a sea of information. Technology can simultaneously enlighten and confuse, offering solutions while posing complex questions. "How careful are you with the mixed signals you may unknowingly be conveying?" Explore MIXED SIGNALS, where technology and communication converge in a symphony of vibrant colors and playful shapes.
